Review Questins:

1- What do you know about branching statements?
2- What is difference between while and do while loop?

Topics:


  - Nested Loop
  - System.exists(0);

==============================

- Nested Loop: loop inside a loop (inner & outer)
		
		outer loop repeats the inner


- we can implement more than one loop inside the other loop

=================================
- we have different types branching statements these are :

break: exits the loop & switch
continue: skips the current iteration of the loop
System.exit(0): terminates the current program, terminates the JVM


============================
Tasks:
 
 -- Task 1: Find the number taht given a hidden number between 1 and 100 randomly created. 

 Hint:   Random random=new Random();

        int hiddenNumber = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
  

-- Task 2:  Write a programt that replaces every occurrence of "cat" in the message with "dog", using indexOf and substring.

  input: 

  String message = "I love cats! I have a cat named Coco. My cat's very smart!";

  output:

 "I love dogs! I have a dog named Coco. My dog's very smart!";



--  Task 3: Count each name in sentence.
  
    input : 

  String names = "Adam Adam Barry Aysun Aysun";

    output: 

    Adam-2 Barry-1 Aysun-2      

--  Task 4: Reverse each word in a sentence.
  
    input:
 
    String str = "Adam come here";

    output:
